                it’s never been easier to connect with people who speak this language. They 
                want others to build up their self-image and confidence, and digital connectivity 
                creates ample opportunity to tell your audience why they’re awesome. Move 
                beyond general flattery and focus on specifics. Ask yourself, “How can I make 
                my audience feel good about themselves?”

                One option might be developing a blog series that focuses on industry wins, or 
                spotlights companies that are doing something right. Or if you share an article 
                with your network, you could point out a quote from the author that really 
                resonates with you. Don’t just tell your audience you love them; tell them why.
