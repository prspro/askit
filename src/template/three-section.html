            it’s never been easier to connect with people who speak this language. They 
            want others to build up their self-image and confidence, and digital connectivity 
            creates ample opportunity to tell your audience why they’re awesome. Move 
            beyond general flattery and focus on specifics. Ask yourself, “How can I make 
            my audience feel good about themselves?”

            One option might be developing a blog series that focuses on industry wins, or 
            spotlights companies that are doing something right. Or if you share an article 
            with your network, you could point out a quote from the author that really 
            resonates with you. Don’t just tell your audience you love them; tell them why.
